# Airwaves OS System Updater

Airwaves OS updates in layers, all surfaced in the control app under
**Settings → System Update** (`/updates`):

| Layer | What it is | How it updates |
|---|---|---|
| **System Manager** | `ghcr.io/airframesio/airwaves-manager` (Rust API) | pull image, recreate container |
| **Control Panel** | `ghcr.io/airframesio/airwaves-gateway` (nginx + the React control app) | pull image, recreate container |
| **System Configuration** | `/etc/airwaves/docker-compose.yml` | download from manifest (sha256-verified), atomic replace |
| **App Catalog** | `/etc/airwaves/catalog.json` | download from manifest (sha256-verified), atomic replace |
| **OS packages / kernel** | Debian/apt packages | `apt-get upgrade` (reboot-flagged if kernel changed) |
| **Major OS upgrade** | e.g. Bookworm → Trixie | in-place `apt full-upgrade` after repointing apt sources, then reboot |

## Severity

Each update carries a severity, shown as a badge and used to drive the global
banner:

- **nice-to-have** — optional, quality-of-life.
- **recommended** — preferred; apply soon.
- **required** — necessary (security/compat). Surfaced as a red banner across
  the whole app until applied.

## Release manifest

The device checks a JSON manifest for the configured channel:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airframesio/airwaves-os/main/releases/<channel>.json
```

(Default channel `stable` → `releases/stable.json`.) Schema (`schema: 1`):

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "channel": "stable",
  "os_version": "1.0.0",
  "codename": "Sideband",
  "released": "2026-05-28",
  "severity": "recommended",          // rollup = max of components
  "min_os_version": "1.0.0",
  "summary": "…",
  "notes_url": "…",
  "components": {
    "manager":  { "version": "1.0.0", "severity": "recommended", "image": "ghcr.io/…", "tag": "latest" },
    "gateway":  { "version": "1.0.0", "control_app_version": "1.0.0", "severity": "recommended", "image": "ghcr.io/…", "tag": "latest" },
    "compose":  { "version": "1", "severity": "required", "url": "…/docker-compose.yml.template", "sha256": "…" },
    "catalog":  { "version": "1", "severity": "nice-to-have", "url": "…/catalog.json", "sha256": "…" }
  },
  "os": {
    "major_upgrade": null,            // or { "from": "bookworm", "to": "trixie", "severity": "recommended", "guide_url": "…" }
    "reboot_expected": false
  }
}
```

The manager overrides the source with env vars when needed:
`AIRWAVES_MANIFEST_URL` (full URL) or `AIRWAVES_MANIFEST_BASE` (base dir).

## How version detection works

- **manager** — `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` baked into the binary.
- **control app** — the gateway serves `/version.json` (stamped at image build
  from the control-app `package.json` via the `CONTROL_APP_VERSION` build-arg);
  the manager fetches `http://airwaves-gateway/version.json`.
- **compose / catalog** — integer revisions tracked in `/etc/airwaves/.versions.json`.
- **OS** — `/etc/os-release` (codename) + `/etc/airwaves-release` (Airwaves
  version); upgradable package count via `apt-get -s upgrade`.

`semver` is used to compare versions; non-semver strings fall back to string
inequality. `unknown`/empty never counts as an update.

## How applying works (the host updater)

The manager runs *inside* the compose stack, so it cannot recreate itself.
Instead all host mutations go through one audited path:

1. The manager writes a job spec to `/etc/airwaves/update/request.json` and
   triggers `systemctl start airwaves-update.service` (via `nsenter` into the
   host PID namespace — the manager already runs with `pid: host` +
   `HOST_VIA_NSENTER=1`).
2. `/opt/airwaves/scripts/airwaves-update` runs as **host root**, outside the
   container, writing incremental progress to `/etc/airwaves/update/status.json`.
3. Because the status file lives on the host bind-mount, it **survives the
   manager being recreated** mid-update. The control app polls
   `GET /api/v1/system/update/progress` and reconnects automatically.

Steps: snapshot config + image digests → download/verify (sha256) compose &
catalog → `docker compose pull` → `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans` →
**health-gate** (wait for manager + gateway healthy) → on failure **roll back**
config and re-`up` the previous stack → apt upgrade / major upgrade → set
`reboot_required`.

Dry-run: set `AIRWAVES_UPDATE_DRYRUN=1` to log actions without mutating.

## API (manager)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET  | `/api/v1/system/update/status`   | cached check result |
| POST | `/api/v1/system/update/check`    | force a fresh manifest fetch |
| POST | `/api/v1/system/update/apply`    | `{ "components": ["manager","gateway","compose","catalog","os_packages","os_major"] }` or `["all"]` |
| GET  | `/api/v1/system/update/progress` | host updater progress |

A background task re-checks every 12h and broadcasts a `UpdateAvailable`
WebSocket event when a recommended/required update appears.

## Publishing a release

1. Bump component versions (manager `Cargo.toml`, control-app `package.json`,
   `/etc/airwaves-release`, and the `.versions.json` seed in
   `airwaves-base.sh` for compose/catalog as needed).
2. Build & push the container images (CI: **Build Containers**).
3. Recompute `sha256` for the compose template + catalog and update
   `releases/stable.json` (and archive a copy as `releases/<version>.json`).
4. Commit/push. `stable.json` points at `main` (rolling latest); versioned
   manifests should pin their `url`s to the release tag once tags are cut
   (see ROADMAP).

## Bootstrapping existing devices

Devices flashed before the updater existed don't have the host script or the
`pid: host` compose yet. Run once, as root, on the device:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airframesio/airwaves-os/main/scripts/bootstrap-updater.sh | sudo bash
```

This installs the updater + unit, refreshes `docker-compose.yml`, pulls images,
and brings the stack up. After that, updates are fully in-app.

## Limitations

- Container image rollback is best-effort (compose pins `:latest`); config-file
  rollback is exact. Atomic, rollback-safe OS updates are tracked for A/B
  partitions — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- Major in-place Debian upgrades are powerful but inherently risky without A/B
  partitions; back up first.

## Update channels

Devices track one of three channels, stored in `/etc/airwaves/.versions.json`
(`"channel"`), which selects the manifest fetched (`releases/<channel>.json`):

- **stable** — production releases (default).
- **beta** — early access to upcoming releases.
- **dev** — bleeding edge; may be unstable.

Switch channels in the control app (System Update → channel selector) or via
the API:

```
POST /api/v1/system/update/channel   { "channel": "beta" }
```

Switching persists the choice and immediately re-checks against the new
channel's manifest.

### How channels map to images (CI)

The **Build Containers** workflow tags images by git ref so each channel has
its own moving image tag, plus an immutable version tag and a `sha-` tag:

| Git ref | Channel | Image tags published |
|---|---|---|
| push to `main` | **dev** | `dev`, `<version>`, `sha-…` |
| push to `beta` branch | **beta** | `beta`, `<version>`, `sha-…` |
| push tag `v*` | **stable** | `stable`, `latest`, `<version>`, `sha-…` |
| `workflow_dispatch` | choose (`auto` infers from branch) | as above |

(`<version>` = manager `Cargo.toml` / control-app `package.json`.)

Each channel manifest (`releases/<channel>.json`) pins the component `tag` to
its channel:

- `stable.json` → immutable version tag (e.g. `1.0.3`) for reproducibility;
  bump on each stable release.
- `beta.json` → `beta` (moving; republished on every `beta` branch push).
- `dev.json` → `dev` (moving; republished on every `main` push).

On apply, the host updater rewrites `docker-compose.yml` to the manifest's
pinned tag before pulling, so a `dev` device runs `:dev`, a `beta` device runs
`:beta`, and `stable` devices stay on the exact stable version — no fighting
over `:latest`.

### Publishing per channel

- **dev**: merge to `main`. CI builds, publishes `<version>-dev.<run#>`, and the
  `pin-manifest` job auto-updates `releases/dev.json` to that concrete tag — no
  manual manifest edit. The unique `<run#>` makes each dev build a distinct
  concrete tag, so dev devices detect and pull the exact new image.
- **beta**: push the `beta` branch. Same flow → `<version>-beta.<run#>`, manifest
  pinned automatically.
- **stable**: push a `v<version>` tag (builds `stable` + `latest` + version);
  bump versions and `releases/stable.json` to the version tag, and recompute the
  compose/catalog `sha256`. (Stable is human-maintained, not auto-pinned.)

All `releases/*.json` are read from `main`, so update the channel manifest on
`main` even when the images came from another branch.
