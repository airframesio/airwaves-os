# Airwaves OS

## Download

An official public build has not been released yet while we work out some issues.

## Building images

Airwaves OS can be built locally on a desktop for various architectures using the Armbian build flow, or via GitHub
for releases.

### Locally

1. Clone the repository to a Linux system, preferably Ubuntu 20.04.
2. Start the build with the build script `./armbian-build.sh`.

### GitHub

GitHub workflows will be triggered that will build the Airwaves OS images for various platforms.
